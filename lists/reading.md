# Reading list

~~Books~~ Stuff I've read throughout the years.  
Some link to a footnote where I give a short sentence or two (more accurately, a couple of words) to describe how I felt about them.

* [Everyone Talks About Insecure Randomness, But Nobody Does Anything About It](https://www.airza.net/2020/11/09/everyone-talks-about-insecure-randomness-but-nobody-does-anything-about-it.html), by [John Labelle](https://www.airza.net) (2020)

[^responsibility]: Read it here: https://qntm.org/responsibility. Similar in concept to the TV show [Devs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs). Great read.
[^miso]: Suspenseful, eerie, disturbing. Very odd.
[^chocky]: Fantastic.
