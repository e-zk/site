# Reading list

~~Books~~ Stuff I've read throughout the years.  
Some link to a footnote where I give a short sentence or two (more accurately, a couple of words) to describe how I felt about them.

## 2020

* _I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility_, by qntm (2007) [Short story]  
  Read it here: https://qntm.org/responsibility. Similar in concept to the TV show [Devs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs). Great read.
* _Neuromancer_, by William Gibson (1984)  
* _In the Miso Soup_, by Ryu Murakami (1997/2003)  
  Suspenseful, eerie, disturbing. Very odd.
* _Chocky_, by John Wyndham (1968)  
  This is a really great science fiction book about a child called Matthew and his imaginary friend, Chocky. But it turns out that Chocky is far from imaginary...
* _Brave New World_, by Aldous Huxley (1932)  
* _Modes of Operation of the AES Algorithm_, by D. Blazhevski, A. Bozhinovski, B. Stojchevska, and V. Pachovski (CIIT 2013) \[Paper\]
