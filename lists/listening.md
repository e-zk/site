## Albums + EPs
* **Boards of Canada - Geogaddi** (2002) \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4ETOSQC0coJld1OxCLhN_rccDygSJ-hj)\]  
  My all-time favourite BoC album. Calming and chill yet somehow sinister at the same time. BoC manages to bring feelings of the occult, the mystery of number stations and ambient electronic music into one Lofi IDM masterpiece.
* **Crystal Castles - Amnesty(I)** (2016) \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU3b72dVLWQ)\]  
  Abrasive and in-your-face yet dancey and at times suspenseful (in the case of the intro track).
* **Neurolucifer - Entropy** (2018) \[[bc](https://lainlabel.bandcamp.com/album/entropy)\]  
  Criminally underrated IDM with an interesting mix of glitch-y breakcore textures with a great ambient atmosphere to it too.
* **FKA twigs - MAGDALENE** (2019) \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fop8j8QWsA&list=PLZ9DoO2uX9wU3-o1IzUnAvkP7nB0dxY2_)\]  
  FKA twigs delivers her iconic haunting, sensual and evocative vocals on top of minimalist electronic and trap beats.  
* **OSC - Girls On Bikes** (2017) \[[bc](https://opussciencecollective.bandcamp.com/album/girls-on-bikes-2)\]  
  Simple, fun 80s retro. Very vaporwave.
* **MF Doom - Operation Doomsday** (1999)  
  One of the best hip-hop records of all time in my opinion. Jazzy hip-hop beats coupled with Daniel Dumile's dense rhyme style and cheeky lyricism never disapoint.
* **Killer Bee  - Venus** (2017) \[[bc](https://prodbykillerbee.bandcamp.com/album/venus-ep)\]  
  A welcome synergy of Lofi and Hip-hop drum patterns. This anime-inspired EP is relaxing and is reminiscent of lounging around on a warm Saturday afternoon.
* **Kikuchi Momoko - Adventure** (1986) \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hv6IE8l2TA)\]  
  Hands down one of the best Japanese Citypop albums ever. 
* **Kate Bush - Hounds of Love** (1985) \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rIjsa85UVk&list=PLa3HlKFsnLvb0eynJyk7TY-jQYTaqK_eD)\]  
  Fantastic piece of art-pop from the 80s.
* **Desired - PLASTIC WHATEVER** (2018) \[[bc](https://neoncityrecords.bandcamp.com/album/plastic-whatever)\]  
  Great future funk album. Makes me feel like I'm drinking sweet Pepsi while walking through a bustling neon city at night. 
* **Skepta - Ignorance is Bliss (2019)** \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXFhPkBO5eSWpktHGjwog_0Qx2GePTJYk)\]  
  Modern UK hip-hop/Grime at its finest. Catchy with exceptional production and occasional thought-provoking lyrics.
* **Caroline Polachek - Pang** (2019) \[[bc](https://carolinepolachek.bandcamp.com/album/pang)\]  
  Experimental, catchy, ambient, modern art-pop masterpiece featuring PC Music producers A.G Cook and Danny L Harle. Art-pop is the future of pop and that future is now!
* **Daft Punk - Discovery** (2001) \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSdoVPM5WnndSQEXRz704yQkKwx76GvPV)\]  
  The classic electronic french house album. Close to my heart and many childhood memories. Future funk before future funk was a thing.
* **Chon - Grow** (2015) \[[yt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH22-xSMERQrmeOAp7kJy-0BHfGJbl8Aw)\]  
  Chilled out progressive rock that makes you want to close your eyes and relax as you dream about nothing in particular.
