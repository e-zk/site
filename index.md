# Hey, I'm Zakaria

A CS graduate with an interest in information security, digital privacy,
and cryptography. I currently work in cyber security, I write [code](#code)
for fun, and I try to [read](/bookshelf/) in my spare time too. Oh, and I also
sometimes [blog](/posts/) about anything I feel like (opinions are my own).

If you'd like to reach me you can do so [here](/about.html#contact).
