Welcome to the index.html of zakaria.org! The personal website of one Zakaria Khamissa.

## Writings

You can find blog posts [here](/posts/). I blog about \*nix, security, books, and anything I feel like really.  
A very messy and rudimentary personal wiki can also be found at [wiki.zakaria.org](https://wiki.zakaria.org/ "it's messy - you have been warned").

## Code

Publicly hosted code of mine can be found in a few places:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/e-zk/) - For most projects and open-source contributions
* [git.zakaria.org](https://git.zakaria.org/) - Personal git server (with fewer, and much smaller projects)
