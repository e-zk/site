<p>In my <a href="https://zakaria.org/posts/2020-08-01-shblog">previous post</a> I wrote about mostly M4 templates.
Well, it turns out I&#39;ve run into some issues.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter%20I:%20The%20Problem">Chapter I: The Problem</h2>

<p>I ran my blog script to convert my markdown into a nice HTML webpage, but then something happened. Nothing. Nothing happened. The script just sat there, stuck. This was odd because the script usually runs in under a second, so something had to have gone wrong&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="Chapter%20II:%20The%20Quick%20Fix">Chapter II: The Quick Fix</h2>

<p>I turned on tracing in my <code>head.m4</code> by adding <code>traceon</code> to the start of the file then I ran the script again. I knew instantly what had gone wrong&#8230; M4 was spitting out the same HTML over and over and over again: It was expanding the macros I had written in my post! Creating an infinite loop.</p>

<p>As a quick fix in the post I replaced all occurrences of my actual macros with ones that were slightly different. It worked! &#8230;but then M4 gave another error: </p>

<pre><code>m4: unexpected end of input, unclosed parenthesis:
</code></pre>

<h2 id="Chapter%20III:%20The%20Root%20of%20All%20Evil">Chapter III: The Root of All Evil</h2>

<p>In my search for answers I came across this post: <a href="http://silas.net.br/tech/devel/m4.html">http:&#47;&#47;silas.net.br&#47;tech&#47;devel&#47;m4.html</a>. While the particular issue in on the webpage wasn&#39;t <em>my</em> issue, it gave me a hint as to what had gone wrong. M4 must have been trying to expand or evaluate something else in my post&#39;s text. Eventually I figured out that M4 was trying to run all the <code>define()</code> and <code>include()</code> statements I had written in my post. Needless to say, writing a post about M4 while using M4 for my templates was causing some issues&#8230;</p>

<p>As a crappy bandaid I added a couple of <code>sed</code>s to my script:</p>

<pre><code>article_html=$(echo "$article_html" |  sed -E -e "s&#47;define\(&#47;\&#39;!define\(!\"&#47;g" -e "s&#47;include\(&#47;\&#39;!include\(!\"&#47;g")
</code></pre>

<p>Because I only wrote <code>define</code> and <code>include</code> in my M4 code snippets for the post, this worked just fine. (Hopefully it works for this post too).</p>

<p>I may have to rethink using M4 completely because I won&#39;t lie I have no idea what I&#39;m doing - it seems like I&#39;m bound to run into this issue or a similar one in the future. Maybe Timmy was wrong; maybe I should just <code>echo</code> a bunch of HTML in my script instead, surely it can&#39;t be that messy. We&#39;ll have to see what I come up with.</p>

<p>For now, consider my <a href="https://zakaria.org/posts/2020-08-01-shblog">previous post</a> to be non-cannon in the <code>&#47;bin&#47;sh</code> blog series (if you can really call it a series - there hasn&#39;t even been a part II yet!).</p>
