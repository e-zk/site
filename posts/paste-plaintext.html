<h1 id="paste-as-plaintext">Paste as plaintext</h1>

<p>I use Windows for work. I used to use it at home. But now I only use it at
work<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Anyways, for quite a while (many years now) in &ldquo;modern&rdquo; GUI
applications+operating systems there&rsquo;s been this feature where if you copy some
styled text, usually from the web, it tries to copy that formatting across to
wherever you&rsquo;re pasting it as well (if it supports styled text).</p>

<p>For example if I select and ctrl+c copy some <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> from an article on a
website, and I ctrl+v paste that in MS Teams, that <code>h1</code>&rsquo;s basic CSS/rich-text
styling (text size, sometimes font, colour, hrefs, etc) will get pasted into
my Teams text-input. This happens for pasting in a many other GUI applications
too.</p>

<p>The worst is when it pastes white-coloured text from a site that uses white on
black<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Teams by default has a &lsquo;bright&rsquo; interface, so&hellip; you can&rsquo;t see shit.</p>

<p>The only very very rare time it is ever useful is copying across a table into
an email or Teams message.</p>

<p>My question is; who the fuck asked for this? Who makes use of this on the
daily and is very impressed by its addition to our lives?<br>
I mean, it just seems like it&rsquo;d be useless for everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re copying some text from a site into your Word document &ndash; surely
you&rsquo;d want it to match the style of your Word document, right?</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re pasting that text in a Teams message &ndash; do you <em>really enjoy</em> the
weird out-of-place style the text has in contrast to the rest of your
default-styled message? (Same goes for pasting into rich-text emails).</li>
<li>Do you really just absolutely <em>love it</em> when after pasting that styled text
the rest of your following typed text inherits that awful, out-of-pace
style of the text you pasted? Oh, <em>you do</em> like that, huh? Freak.</li>
</ul>

<p>Who decided it should be rich-text by default? And am I the only one who
<em>doesn&rsquo;t like it?</em> Am I the only one who this frustrates on the daily? Am I
the only one who can&rsquo;t stand having to open Notepad and paste shit in there
first to get rid of formatting? Maybe there&rsquo;s just a simple solution I&rsquo;m not
aware of.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can right click and &ldquo;paste as plaintext&rdquo;. There probably is a keybind
to do this, but it depends on the application:
Is it ctrl+alt+v? or ctrl+shift+v? or is it something completely different?<br>
The clipboard should just be plaintext-by-default! Everything else
should be under an optional keybind or context menu. <em>Not the other way around</em>.</p>

<p>If you enjoy the copy with formatting &ldquo;feature&rdquo;, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to email
me. Just know I will take great pleasure putting that email straight into the
trash.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>
