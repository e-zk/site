# Paste as plaintext

I use Windows for work. I used to use it at home. But now I only use it at
work[^1].

[^1]: "use" is too pleasant a word, actually. I "deal with it". I "deal" with
      Windows.

Anyways, for quite a while (many years now) in "modern" GUI
applications+operating systems there's been this feature where if you copy some
styled text, usually from the web, it tries to copy that formatting across to
wherever you're pasting it as well (if it supports styled text). 

For example if I select and ctrl+c copy some `<h1>` from an article on a
website, and I ctrl+v paste that in MS Teams, that `h1`'s basic CSS/rich-text
styling (text size, sometimes font, colour, hrefs, etc) will get pasted into
my Teams text-input. This happens for pasting in a many other GUI applications
too.

The worst is when it pastes white-coloured text from a site that uses white on
black[^2]. Teams by default has a 'bright' interface, so... you can't see shit.

[^2]: Not usually actually white foreground on black background -- most sites
      know not to assault their user's eyes with such contrast (unless for
      [a11y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)
      reasons).

The only very very rare time it is ever useful is copying across a table into
an email or Teams message.

My question is; who the fuck asked for this? Who makes use of this on the
daily and is very impressed by its addition to our lives?  
I mean, it just seems like it'd be useless for everyone:
 - If you're copying some text from a site into your Word document -- surely
   you'd want it to match the style of your Word document, right?
 - If you're pasting that text in a Teams message -- do you _really enjoy_ the
   weird out-of-place style the text has in contrast to the rest of your
   default-styled message? (Same goes for pasting into rich-text emails).
 - Do you really just absolutely _love it_ when after pasting that styled text
   the rest of your following typed text inherits that awful, out-of-pace
   style of the text you pasted? Oh, _you do_ like that, huh? Freak.

Who decided it should be rich-text by default? And am I the only one who
_doesn't like it?_ Am I the only one who this frustrates on the daily? Am I
the only one who can't stand having to open Notepad and paste shit in there
first to get rid of formatting? Maybe there's just a simple solution I'm not
aware of.

Yeah, I can right click and "paste as plaintext". There probably is a keybind 
to do this, but it depends on the application:
Is it ctrl+alt+v? or ctrl+shift+v? or is it something completely different?  
The clipboard should just be plaintext-by-default! Everything else
should be under an optional keybind or context menu. _Not the other way around_.

If you enjoy the copy with formatting "feature", please don't hesitate to email
me. Just know I will take great pleasure putting that email straight into the
trash.

Peace.
