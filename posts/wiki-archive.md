# Goodbye wiki.zakaria.org (for now)

![wiki homepage](/static/img/wiki.png)

I setup [wiki.zakaria.org](https://wiki.zakaria.org/) some time ago. It's
ended up becoming really really stale and unused[^1]. I'm going to
"decomission" it soon. I thought I'd make this post on the main blog to
reflect a little bit on what its purpose was, and to archive some of the
things I had written on there.

[^1]: It hasn't been updated in four (4) years! damn!

## The idea of the personal wiki

So I had this idea for a personal wiki. I'd basically dump as much knowledge
as I could into it: rough notes, useful command flags, config files, code
snippets, anything and everything I wanted to just take note of for later.

I wanted the style ofit to be more "hacker"-y than the blog here. So
naturally that means dark background + green, monospaced text.

The rest of this post will just be a breakdown of every page I had on there
(there weren't many).

## [The stat command](https://archive.md/uRACS)

![stat command](/static/img/wiki-stat.png)

This one was pretty simple. I just noticed that BSD and non-BSD `stat`
commands had different flags for formatting. Often I'd like to get the octal
representation of a file's Unix permissions, so I documented the differences.

## Devices / [Laptop setup](https://archive.md/Ytylb)

![laptop setup](/static/img/wiki-laptop.png)


The basic idea here was to document my Laptop's config. I'm typing on that
same X1 Carbon right now, actually. But I ditched Windows completely and just
run OpenBSD on it now.

## Devices / [Mobile device setup](https://archive.md/BPnCq)

![phone setup](/static/img/wiki-phone.png)

This one I was pretty proud of. I documented my Pixel 4a setup: OS, installed
apps, etc. I took a cool photo of my phone on the homescreen too. My setup has
changed quite a lot since.  
I'll  probably re-do these device setup ones at some point, I think it's
pretty fun to write about, I love showing off my workflow and customisation.

## Notes / [BIP39 and Mnemonic Seeds](https://archive.md/LQcMC)

![bip39 notes](/static/img/wiki-bip39.png)

As the title says (albeit originally misspelt). I had some interest in how
Monero, and other cryptocurrencies converted their private key seeds to
phrase-based seeds.

## Notes / [YubiKey notes](https://archive.md/zzsMs)

![yubikey notes](/static/img/wiki-yubikey.png)

Notes on setting up resident SSH keys on the YubiKey

## Privsec / [Changing $HOME](https://archive.md/3dbXR)

![changing HOME](/static/img/wiki-home.png)

This is about a cool trick I use all the time. Most applications
use the `$HOME` environment variable to determine the current home directory
(naturally). You can change `$HOME` to whatever you want. Can be useful.

## Privsec / [NFT](https://archive.md/aCxnf)

![NFT](/static/img/wiki-nft.png)

Notes + template for Linux NFT.

## Privsec / Windows Sandbox

This just became the [Windows Sandbox](/posts/winsandbox.html) post here on
the main blog. It's the same thing.

## Going forward

Yeah so I might revive the wiki subdomain but it's not gonna have the same
stuff. I don't really have the time at the moment to invest too heavily into a 
new side project either. We'll see.
