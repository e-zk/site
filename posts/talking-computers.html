<h1 id="i-don-t-like-it-when-computers-talk-to-me">I don&rsquo;t like it when computers talk to me</h1>

<p>The recent, ongoing, AI-chatbot boom has made me realise how annoying I think
it is when software tries to &ldquo;talk to me&rdquo;, like its a fellow human being.
But it isn&rsquo;t just annoying &ndash; it feels wrong to me now.</p>

<p>When I was much younger I used to enjoy and even write my own software<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
that would include flavour text<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> abundantly. Things like &ldquo;Welcome,
${user}!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good {morning|evening}&rdquo;, &ldquo;What would you like to do today?&rdquo;, etc.
It gave a cool futuristic vibe; &ldquo;Wow! My computer is talking to me!&rdquo;
But as the years go on I find I just want straight answers from computers.</p>

<p>Some other real examples of flavour text that I don&rsquo;t like:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Enter your password to unlock your account&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Something went wrong when trying to access your account&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you set up!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hey there! You might want to enable backups. Click here to find out more&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>We managed to understand Eftpos machines when they had crappy monochrome LCD
screens, and gave us direct, almost brutal messaging like &ldquo;ENTER PIN&rdquo;,
&ldquo;INCORRECT PIN&rdquo;, &ldquo;ACCESS DENIED&rdquo;. In a way, honestly think we had it right
back then.</p>

<p>My use of LLM chatbost is basically negligble. I have used them on very rare
occasion for mundane tasks like converting some unweildly Markdown table to
TOML. I rarely actualy &ldquo;converse&rdquo; with LLMs for any kind of research or code
generation or anything like that. I just feel like chat is such a weird medium
for &ldquo;AI&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m aware that due to the nature of LLMs it is basically
the most direct interface for it (I think?). I can&rsquo;t think of a better idea,
and I&rsquo;m certain you can tune down the conversationality of LLM models, but it
still just seems weird. Like it&rsquo;s pretending to be a person, even though I
know it isn&rsquo;t, even though the LLM itself knows it isn&rsquo;t a person<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re both playing pretend.</p>

<p>Purely as an interface to a tool chat seems lossy.
It is easy for either side of the conversation to be &ldquo;misinterpereted&rdquo;, for
context to be lost. Further it just feels plain weird to me to speak to a
computer, and I hate it when it &ldquo;speaks&rdquo; back.</p>

  In the context of this post, I
  mean that it tries to add &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; or &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; to the &ldquo;data&rdquo;
  that the software is actually trying to present.</p> <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:2"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
