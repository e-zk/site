# I don't like it when computers talk to me

The recent, ongoing, AI-chatbot boom has made me realise how annoying I think
it is when software tries to "talk to me", like it's a fellow human being.
But it isn't just annoying -- it feels wrong to me now. 

When I was much younger I used to enjoy and even write my own software[^1]
that would include flavour text[^2] abundantly. Things like "Welcome,
${user}!", "Good {morning|evening}", "What would you like to do today?", etc.
It gave a cool futuristic vibe; "Wow! My computer is talking to me!"
But as the years go on I find I just want straight answers from computers.

Some other real examples of flavour text that I don't like:

- "Enter your password to unlock your account"
- "Something went wrong when trying to access your account"
- "Let's get you set up!"
- "Hey there! You might want to enable backups. Click here to find out more"

We managed to understand Eftpos machines when they had crappy monochrome LCD
screens, and gave us direct, almost brutal messaging like "ENTER PIN",
"INCORRECT PIN", "ACCESS DENIED". In a way, honestly think we had it right
back then.

My use of LLM chatbot is basically negligible. I have used them on very rare
occasion for mundane tasks like converting some unwieldy Markdown table to
TOML. I rarely actually "converse" with LLMs for any kind of research or code 
generation or anything like that. I just feel like chat is such a weird medium
for "AI". I'm aware that due to the nature of LLMs it is basically
the most direct interface for it (I think?). I can't think of a better idea,
and I'm certain you can tune down the conversationality of LLM models, but it
still just seems weird. Like it's pretending to be a person, even though I
know it isn't, even though the LLM itself knows it isn't a person[^3].
It's like we're both playing pretend.

Purely as an interface to a tool chat seems lossy.
It is easy for either side of the conversation to be "misinterpreted", for
context to be lost. Further it just feels plain weird to me to speak to a
computer, and I hate it when it "speaks" back.

[^1]: "Software" like Rainmeter skins and new-tab pages for Chrome.
[^2]: [Flavour text](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flavor_text) in a gaming
      context adds to the game's atmosphere but not to the game mechanics.
      In the context of this post, I
      mean that it tries to add "atmosphere" or "conversation" to the "data"
      that the software is actually trying to present.
[^3]: They don't "know" anything, but hopefully my point still resonates.
