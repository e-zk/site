# There's nothing to do

You ever feel like there's nothing to do?

Of course there's things you _should_ be doing... but you don't want to do any
of that. You want something else... Something stimulating but not... work.
Not housework, not study work, and not "work" work.
(Definitely not that last one).
Maybe you have a hobby (you do have one, right?) but you just can't be
bothered with that either?

You ever feel like you've "finished the internet," as my mother says?

You've caught up with all your feeds. You've read all the blogs. Checked all
the forums. You've even run out of YouTube videos to watch!
Of course the internet is virtually infinite and yet... it feels like
you've seen it all today?

If any of that is you I have the solution! Pick up a book.
A real, physical, in your hands book. You do have some of those, right?

Oh. You can't be bothered with that either?  
To be honest, me neither.

So then... What do we do now?
