<p class="info">2021-01-11 &bullet; Usbkill the OpenBSD way &bullet; Using OpenBSD's hotplugd to thwart HID attacks</p>
<h1 id="%3Ccode%3Eusbkill%3C/code%3E%20the%20OpenBSD%20way"><code>usbkill</code> the OpenBSD way</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/hephaest0s/usbkill"><code>usbkill</code></a> is a kill-switch that shuts down your computer on any USB change. It does this by watching the output of <code>lsusb</code> and when there is a change it runs <code>shutdown -h now</code>.</p>

<p>Simple, right? One thing to note is that <code>lsusb</code> is not included in OpenBSD&#8217;s base packages, but <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hotplugd"><code>hotplugd(8)</code></a> is.</p>

<h2 id="hotplugd">hotplugd</h2>

<p>So what is <code>hotplugd</code>, and how can it be useful? The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hotplugd">man page</a> does a good job of explaining it. Simply put: when any device is attached to or detached from your machine <code>hotplugd</code> will execute a script.</p>

<p>To see how simple it is to write a hotplug script we can start by simply logging device attach events. First, start by enabling and starting <code>hotplugd</code> (as root):</p>

<pre><code># rcctl enable hotplugd
# rcctl start hotplugd
hotplugd(ok)
</code></pre>

<p>Next we will write the script that is executed on a device attach event:</p>

<pre><code># mkdir -p &#47;etc&#47;hotplug
# $EDITOR &#47;etc&#47;hotplug&#47;attach
</code></pre>

<p>In this file we will log the device class and name:</p>

<pre><code>#!&#47;bin&#47;sh

DEVCLASS=$1
DEVNAME=$2

# log attach event
logger -t hotplug "$DEVCLASS:$DEVNAME attached"
</code></pre>

<p>To see this in action in another terminal type</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f &#47;var&#47;log&#47;messages
</code></pre>

<p>Then connect a USB device to your machine and you should see messages tagged &#8216;hotplug&#8217;. This is what I get when I plug in my Logitech USB adapter for my wireless mouse (which I usually don&#8217;t use):</p>

<pre><code>Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhid3 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 5:wsmouse2 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:ums0 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhid1 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 5:wskbd1 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhid0 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhid4 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhid2 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhidev1 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhidev2 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:ukbd0 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhidev0 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhid5 attached
Jan 11 11:48:32 x1 hotplug: 0:uhid6 attached
</code></pre>

<p>Site note: What is happening here? Why have so many events popped up after inserting one USB device? My theory is that because it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/product/unifying-receiver-usb">Unifying Receiver</a>, it allows more than one Logitech HID to be connected to a single receiver, so it must register a bunch of HIDs to the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="The%20&amp;#8216;kill&amp;#8217;%20part">The &#8216;kill&#8217; part</h2>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve seen how <code>hotplugd</code> works, we can work on the <em>kill</em> part of <code>usbkill</code>.<br/>
We want to shutdown the machine on a device attach or detach event, but we also want to be able to arm and disarm the <em>kill</em> part, since I might need to plug something in once in a while. Make the <code>&#47;etc&#47;hotplug&#47;attach</code> script as so:</p>

<pre><code>#!&#47;bin&#47;sh

arm_file=&#47;tmp&#47;arm_usbkill

DEVCLASS="$1"
DEVNAME="$2"

logger -t "${0##*&#47;}" "${DEVCLASS}:${DEVNAME} attached"

if [ -f "$arm_file" ]; then
        shutdown -p now
else
        logger -t "${0##*&#47;}" "unarmed - aborted shutdown"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>&#47;tmp&#47;arm_usbkill</code> file exists then the machine will shutdown, if it doesn&#8217;t exist it will just add a log entry to syslog.</p>

<p><code>hotplug</code> also supports running a different script, <code>&#47;etc&#47;hotplug&#47;detach</code> on detach events. Since both scripts are exactly the same I&#8217;ve symlinked the attach script to the location of the detach script.</p>

<pre><code># ln -s &#47;etc&#47;hotplug&#47;attach &#47;etc&#47;hotplug&#47;detach
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>${0##*&#47;}</code> logger tag gets substituted to the filename of the script being executed (in this case it is either <code>attach</code> or <code>detach</code>).</p>

<p>One thing to note is that this setup will execute the shutdown command on <em>any</em> device change event. This includes USBs but also includes network devices, disk drives, and serial line interfaces<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If that is a problem, you can implement a device class-based whitelist by checking <code>$DEVCLASS</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!&#47;bin&#47;sh

# class whitelist (space-separated)
class_whitelist="0 2 3 5"

# arm file
arm_file=&#47;tmp&#47;arm_usbkill

DEVCLASS="$1"
DEVNAME="$2"

whitelisted() {
    for class in $class_whitelist; do
        if [ "$class" = "$1" ]; then
            return 0
        fi
    done
    return 1
}

logger -t "${0##*&#47;}" "${DEVCLASS}:${DEVNAME} attached"

if [ -f "$arm_file" ]; then
    if whitelisted "$DEVCLASS"; then
        logger -t "${0##*&#47;}" "whitelisted - aborted shutdown"
        exit 0
    fi
    shutdown -p now
else
    logger -t "${0##*&#47;}" "unarmed - aborted shutdown"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>But this is not really useful to me since I use a laptop and I&#8217;m not attaching and detaching network devices or disk drives.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of this setup is the inability to whitelist devices based on their USB IDs like you can with <code>usbkill</code>. This could be acheived through a much more complicated script using <code>usbdevs</code> to get USB IDs, but as of yet I have no need for that.</p>

<h2 id="Arming%20and%20disarming">Arming and disarming</h2>

<p>To arm and disarm this script all you have to do is create or remove the <code>$arm_file</code> respectively. Here are some shell functions to add to your shell rc to make it easier:</p>

<pre><code># arm&#47;disarm usbkill
arm() {
        touch &#47;tmp&#47;arm_usbkill &#38;&#38; printf &#39;armed\\n&#39; || printf &#39;error arming\\n&#39;
}
disarm() {
        rm -f &#47;tmp&#47;arm_usbkill &#38;&#38; printf &#39;disarmed\\n&#39; || printf &#39;error disarming\\n&#39;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The script can be armed or disarmed by any regular user which may or may not be preferable to you (and isn&#8217;t the case for <code>usbkill</code>, which requires root to run).<br/>
Originally I had added the <code>uchg</code> flag to the file to lock it. But this proved to be counterproductive since it wasn&#8217;t cleared from <code>&#47;tmp</code> on reboot and when <code>hotplugd</code> would first start up, it would immediately shutdown the machine again. That was fun to fix (not).</p>

<h2 id="Why?">Why?</h2>

<p>So why do all this? Why not just <code>pkg_add usbutils</code>, download + run <code>usbkill</code> and be done?<br/>
Well for starters that isn&#8217;t as fun. The main reason is that all this works in a default OpenBSD install - no additional packages needed. Why install a program to solve a problem when the default tools and services can solve the problem just as (if not more) elegantly?</p>

<li>OpenBSD includes the <code>usbdevs(8)</code> tool in base that lists connected USB devices and their IDs: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/usbdevs">https:&#47;&#47;man.openbsd.org&#47;usbdevs</a> <sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>

<li>A couple of years ago I wrote <a href="https://github.com/e-zk/hidlock">a hotplug script</a> that instead runs <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xlock"><code>xlock(1)</code></a> on all running X displays after a HID is attached. In theory this would to thwart HID&#47;badusb attacks, while not being as aggressive as shutting down your machine. Might be worth looking into if you like the sound of that.</li>
