# Quick setup script with `tmux`

In my network security class we ssh into a handful of VMs pretty often.  
Instead of trying to juggle 5 open terminal windows I tried to make this a bit easier to manage by having all my ssh sessions run in separate tmux windows - switching between them with `C-b {1,2,3,etc}` when necessary. I found myself doing this every time I'd load up my Kali Linux VM:

	tmux
	C-b c
	ssh bastion
	C-b c
	ssh proxyserver
	C-b c
	ssh edgerouter

But then I thought, why not script this process? It should be easy enough. And it sure was easy. Here's what I came up with:

	#!/bin/sh
	
	tmux new-session -d
	tmux new-window -n "bastion" ssh bastion
	tmux new-window -n "proxyserver" ssh proxyserver
	tmux new-window -n "appserver" ssh appserver
	tmux new-window -n "edgerouter" ssh edgerouter
	tmux selectw -t 0
	
	tmux attach-session -d

First, the script creates a new tmux session in the background. Then it opens a new window for each ssh session, naming them appropriately. After that it switches back to the first window (which is just a local shell), and finally it attaches the tmux session to the current terminal session.  

Now after I start my VM all I have to do is run the script (I called it `setupsess`), and I'm ready to start hacking away at my messy nftables configs.
