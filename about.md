## Code

I code recreationally in a variety of programming languages. I have worked with a lot of Python, PHP, C#, Java, and JavaScript in the past. Nowadays I tend to write a lot of Go, C, and I also enjoy writing shell scripts.

I host most of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/e-zk/ "link to my GitHub"), and a few projects 
on my personal git server [git.zakaria.org](https://git.zakaria.org/ "link to my personal git server").

A select list of my software endevours can be found on the [projects](/projects.html) page.
