# About me

I am Zakaria. People often call me Zak.

I am a CS graduate with an interest in information security, digital privacy,
and cryptography. I currently work in cyber security, I write
[code](/projects.html) for fun, and I try to
[read](/bookshelf/ "link to my bookshelf") in my spare time. I also
[blog](/posts/) about anything I feel like. Opinions are my own.  

You can find me on:
- [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/u/zk)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/e-zk/)

## Contact

You can contact me here: `contact [at} zakaria.org`.  
I use Signal too.
