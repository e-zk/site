# About me

I am a CS graduate with an interest in information security, digital privacy,
and cryptography. I currently work in cyber security, I write [code](#code)
for fun, and I try to [read](/bookshelf/ "link to my bookshelf") in my spare
time. I also [blog](/posts/) about anything I feel like. Opinions are my own.
