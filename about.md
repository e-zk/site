## Code

I code recreationally in a variety of programming languages. I have worked with a lot of Python, PHP, C#, Java, and JavaScript in the past. Nowadays I tend to write a lot of Go, C, and I also enjoy writing shell scripts.

Git repos: [GitHub](https://github.com/e-zk/), [git.zakaria.org](https://git.zakaria.org/).

## Selected projects

A list of all of my programming projects can be found on the [projects page](/projects.html). Here are a few:

### [after](https://github.com/e-zk/after)

This small utility written in C waits for the specified process to exit 
before it outputs a string to standard output. It's useful in situations 
where you've already started a process and want to be notified when it exits.  

### [subc](https://github.com/e-zk/subc)

This [Go module](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/e-zk/subc) is a super simple wrapper for the standard library's `flag`
module to make creating sub commands for CLIs much easier.

### [STSD](https://github.com/e-zk/stsd) (wip)

Secure Time Sync Daemon - a time synchronisation daemon written in Go that does 
not use Network Time Protocol (NTP). See the project [README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-zk/stsd/trunk/README) for more information.
