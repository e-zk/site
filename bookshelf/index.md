## What I read

I'll (try to) read anything. It seems I'm drawn more to "classics", but I'm
not opposed to reading more modern fiction. During my university years I was
into a lot of sci-fi, having gone through some of Philip K. Dick's
bibliography. Looks like recently I went on a bit of an
[absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism#Albert_Camus) streak,
having read, and enjoyed, a bunch of Albert Camus' work. I might need a break
from that now though.  
I read political, religious/spiritual stuff too, but I've decided to exclude
most of that from these lists.

List of books I am currenly reading:

- _Notes from Underground_, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky

## Collecting dust

Following is a table of books I have previously read and are now collecting
dust on my desk, my floor, or in a drawer.  
I try to keep the list in reverse chronological order of when I have read them,
and I include a rating out of 5 here as well. I'm pretty generous with my ratings
-- it's rare that I give anything a score under 3.

| Rating | Meaning                  |
|--------|--------------------------|
| •      | Hated it.                |
| ••     | Didn't like it.          |
| •••    | Pretty good.             |
| ••••   | Really good. Enjoyed it. |
| •••••  | Excellent. Loved it.     |

I have read (and forgotten) so much over the years so this list is not exhaustive.  
This table is highly inspired by [icyphox](https://icyphox.sh/reading/ "reading - icyphox").
