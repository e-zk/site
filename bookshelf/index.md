- _The Plague_ by Albert Camus
- _Against White Feminism: Notes on Disruption_ by Rafia [Zakaria](# "no relation")

## Collecting dust

Following is a table of books I have previously read, and are now collecting dust on my desk.
I try to keep the list in reverse chronological order of when I've read them.  
I have read (and forgotten) so much over the years so this list is not exhaustive.  
This table is highly inspired by [icyphox](https://icyphox.sh/reading/ "reading - icyphox").
